# AIDA DOI repository v2.0a

This is an experiment in setting up a DOI repository website for AIDA, to hold metadata for datasets hosted on the AIDA data hub and to generate landing pages for issued DOIs, presenting metadata machine- and human readable formats suitable for automated DataCite DOI registration.  

You can browse this website at [https://aida-doi-repository.github.io/](https://aida-doi-repository.github.io/).
